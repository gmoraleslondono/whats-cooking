# Weekly Reflection by team member

## Megumi

### Completed tasks
I completed making suggested changes on the Login and Register. I merged the final draft to the Main branch. I reviewed Gloria's styling and made suggestions. I tried to assist Riad's and his coding for Favorites but struggled. I started with the Swagger Documentation and the Powerpoint presentation. 
### Challenges
It was challenging trying my own coding on someone else's alraedy written code; editing/reviewing is difficult. I couldn't help my team mate as much as I would have liked to. 
### Learning insights
Using GitHub's review coding before merging. I learned how to use other's coding, make the table (for favorites) and check if you can have user data shown with favorites table. 
### Personal contributions
-Finishing up my part. 
-Powerpoint presentation.
