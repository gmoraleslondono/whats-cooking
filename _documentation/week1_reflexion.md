### Completed tasks
The first week we thought some different ideas. Then we decided whats cooking app. 
In the beginning of the second week it was finally decided as a recipe application. I took a task fetch from an API for a recipe with that ingredient and categories.
### Challenges
The challenge was agreeing with the application idea and facing the complexity of the task.
### Learning insights
I started learning about how the api works and start working fetching data using api. 
### Personal contributions
I contributed in the meetings and sharing ideas.
