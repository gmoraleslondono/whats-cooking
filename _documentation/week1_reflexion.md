# Weekly Reflection by team member

### Completed tasks
The first week we individually thought of application ideas. On Friday we had a meeting sharing ideas. The challenge was agreeing with the application idea. We agreed for a ‘Welcome to Sweden’ multi-featured app so each of us could integrate our own ideas into one. We decided to spend the weekend marinating the idea and decided how we can work on it and split the roles and tasks.  

In the beginning of the week, we had another meeting. It was decided to reduce the application, and we concluded with changing the application into a recipe application. The application had a login, type in an ingredient and fetch from an API for a recipe with that ingredient, bottom for random recipe, a page that shares the favorite recipe. I took the task for login and registration. I started researching how to create a log in.
