# Weekly Reflection by team member

## Megumi

### Completed tasks
The first week we individually thought of application ideas. We first agreed for a ‘Welcome to Sweden’ multi-featured app so each of us could integrate our own ideas into one. 
We late decided to reduce the application, and we concluded with changing the application into a recipe application. I took the task for login and registration. I started researching how to create a log in. 
### Challenges
The first challenge was agreeing with the application idea. The second challenge is to see how big the app can be and the realistic size and complexity of the task.
### Learning insights
-working in groups and sharing ideas.
### Personal contributions
-shared ideas and participated in meetings.
