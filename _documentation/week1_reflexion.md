# Weekly Reflection by team member

## Megumi

### Completed tasks
The first week we individually thought of application ideas. We first agreed for a ‘Welcome to Sweden’ multi-featured app so each of us could integrate our own ideas into one. We decided to spend the weekend marinating the idea and decided how we can work on it and split the roles and tasks.  

In the beginning of the second week it was decided to reduce the application, and we concluded with changing the application into a recipe application. The application had a login, type in an ingredient and fetch from an API for a recipe with that ingredient, bottom for random recipe, and a section that shares the favorite recipe. I took the task for login and registration. I started researching how to create a log in. 
### Challenges
The first challenge was agreeing with the application idea. The second challenge is to see how big the app can be and the realistic size and complexity of the task.

### Learning insights
How to take a step back and consider other's ideas, to reduce the app size so we can start small and expand if there is more time. 
I started learning about how to create a Login function. 
### Personal contributions
I contributed in the meetings and shared ideas.
