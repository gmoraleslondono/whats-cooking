# Weekly Reflection by team member

## Megumi

### Completed tasks
I added the Register.tsx in the frontend as well.
Since the frontend will be styled by Gloria, I kept the same code from Login she made earlier in the week and added the /register logic in the space provided by Gloria. I also changed some wording on the texts to Register rather than login.
I had a meeting with Gloria to merge my branch into the main – we did a rebase which I learned to do for the first time (I usually use GitHub Desktop - merge main to branch). I saw Michiel’s video on Login using Firebase but I decided to keep using JWT rather than using a social login- this way I can practice using PostgresSQL. 
I started researching how to get a shared database. I saw Michiel’s video on deploying the app on Vercel and he used Atlas for MongoDB database and I searched about a free database for PostgresSQL database. I found superbase, which is free up to 500MG. I shared this idea with Gloria and decided to research further on it to share it with the group. 

I completed making suggested changes on the Login and Register. I merged the final draft to the Main branch. I reviewed Gloria's styling and made suggestions. I tried to assist Riad's and his coding for Favorites but struggled. I started with the Swagger Documentation and the Powerpoint presentation. 
### Challenges
The local server was again disconnected, and I could not double check if the code worked. I later worked on reconnecting the database as insomnia could not find the host again. I changed the host name to ‘localhost’ and restarted the backend. It got connected again and the code was working. I also tested the /verify route to verify if user has a token, it worked.  
It was challenging trying my own coding on someone else's alraedy written code; editing/reviewing is difficult. I couldn't help my team mate as much as I would have liked to. 
### Learning insights
Learned about rebase before merging. 
I learned about social logins. 
I learned about Firebase. 
I learned about the difficulties of connecting the local server to my coding, and one thing that worked last week doesn't work this week. I need to restart the backend even if I have nodemon and it updated automatically. 
Using GitHub's review coding before merging. I learned how to use other's coding, make the table (for favorites) and check if you can have user data shown with favorites table. 
I revised how to set up Swagger Documentation. 
### Personal contributions
Merged first draft of Register and Login components.
Researching about sharing database. 
Started the Powerpoint presentation.
Set up swagger documentation. 

## Suresh

### Completed tasks
I have created a categories.js file in the backend. In the categoryExplorer.tsx file i have done some changes in the api so that it works fine and i can see the list of categories as well. 
### Challenges
 In the categories.js i have made a request so that api link will fetch the data. Even i have made some changes in the index.js file as well. I was getting error so i tried to debug by adding some console.log and check in the console. Then later it works and i can see the list of categories. 

### Learning insights
I learned about the difficulties connecting the local server to my coding and fetching the data using api link.  
### Personal contributions
Merged all of my update branches.
