### Completed tasks
I have created a categories.js file in the backend. In the categoryExplorer.tsx file i have done some changes in the api so that it works fine and i can see the list of categories as well. 
### Challenges
 In the categories.js i have made a request so that api link will fetch the data. Even i have made some changes in the index.js file as well. I was getting error so i tried to debug by adding some console.log and check in the console. Then later it works and i can see the list of categories. 

### Learning insights
I learned about the difficulties connecting the local server to my coding and fetching the data using api link.  
### Personal contributions
Merged all of my update branches.
