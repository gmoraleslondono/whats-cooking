# Weekly Reflection by team member

## Megumi

### Completed tasks
I added the Register.tsx in the frontend as well.
Since the frontend will be styled by Gloria, I kept the same code from Login she made earlier in the week and added the /register logic in the space provided by Gloria. I also changed some wording on the texts to Register rather than login.
I had a meeting with Gloria to merge my branch into the main – we did a rebase which I learned to do for the first time (I usually use GitHub Desktop - merge main to branch). I saw Michiel’s video on Login using Firebase but I decided to keep using JWT rather than using a social login- this way I can practice using PostgresSQL. 
I started researching how to get a shared database. I saw Michiel’s video on deploying the app on Vercel and he used Atlas for MongoDB database and I searched about a free database for PostgresSQL database. I found superbase, which is free up to 500MG. I shared this idea with Gloria and decided to research further on it to share it with the group.  
### Challenges
The local server was again disconnected, and I could not double check if the code worked. I later worked on reconnecting the database as insomnia could not find the host again. I changed the host name to ‘localhost’ and restarted the backend. It got connected again and the code was working. I also tested the /verify route to verify if user has a token, it worked.  
### Learning insights
Learned about rebase before merging. 
I learned about social logins. 
I learned about Firebase. 
I learned about the difficulties of connecting the local server to my coding, and one thing that worked last week doesn't work this week. I need to restart the backend even if I have nodemon and it updated automatically. 
### Personal contributions
Merged first draft of Register and Login components.
Researching about sharing database.
